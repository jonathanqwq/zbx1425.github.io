<br>
The sound.cfg file allows to reference which sound files should be used, how they are called and where they are located relative to the train folder.<br><br>The sound.cfg file is a plain text file encoded in any arbitrary <a href="information_encodings.html">encoding</a>, however, UTF-8 with a byte order mark is the preferred choice. The <a href="information_numberformats.html">parsing model</a> for numbers is <b>Strict</b>. The file is required to be located inside the train folder and is expected to be named <b>sound.cfg</b>. The file is interpreted on a per-line basis, from top to bottom.<br><br>➟ <a href="train_sound_cfg_quick.html">See also the quick reference for the sound.cfg...</a><br>
<br><a name="syntax"></a>
<br><br>
<font size="+1" color="#0080FF">■ 2. Syntax</font><hr>
<br>
<br>Each line in the file can be empty (or solely consist of white spaces) and will be ignored, can mark the beginning of a new section or contain key-value pairs inside a section. All key-value pairs relate to the last section opened.<br><br>A new section is opened by starting the line with an opening bracket (U+005B) and ending it with a closing bracket (U+005D). The text in-between the brackets indicates the name of the section and is case-insensitive. White spaces at the beginning and the end of the line are ignored, as well as at the beginning and the end of the name of the section. Thus, the beginning of the section has the following form:<br><br><span class="command">[NameOfTheSection]</span><br>
<br>
<br>A key-value pair is indicated by giving the key, an equals sign (U+003D) and then the value. The key is case-insensitive. White spaces at the beginning and the end of the line are ignored, as well as in front and after the equals sign. Alternatively, white spaces surrounding the key and the value are ignored. Thus, a key-value pair as the following form:<br><br><span class="command">NameOfTheKey = Value</span><br>
<br>
<br>You can use comments anywhere at the end of a line. A comment is started by a semicolon (U+003B). Comments, if present, are stripped away from all lines before these are processed.<br><br><a name="content"></a>
<br><br>
<font size="+1" color="#0080FF">■ 3. Content of the file</font><hr>
<br>
The first line in the file is required to be the following:<br><br><span class="command">Version 1.0</span><br>
<br>
<br>Following the version line, these are the sections that can be used and their key-value pairs. In all key-value pairs, the parameter <em>FileName</em> corresponds to the file name of the sound to reference, relative to the train folder.<br><br><hr>
