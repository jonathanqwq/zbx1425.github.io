<br>
Within the route and train files, you will encounter numbers like integers or floating-point numbers all the time, occasionally also others. These numbers are required to adhere to a certain format, which is described in the following sections.<br><br>There are two parsing methods for numbers: <b>Strict</b> and <b>Loose</b>. The Strict method is a very tight specification which does not leave space for making typographic mistakes. This method is used in all new file formats. The Loose method is a legacy parsing model required for compatibility with older material. The different files as presented on the <em>Developing for openBVE</em> pages indicate which model is being used. Note that whenever a <em>Loose</em> model is permitted, you can also use the <em>Strict</em> formats as <em>Strict</em> forms a subset of <em>Loose</em>.<br><br><a name="integers"></a>

<font size="+1" color="#0080FF">■ 2. Integers</font><hr>
<br>
<b>Strict:</b> Permitted is any sequence of at least one decimal digit in the range from 0 to 9 (U+0030 - U+0039), optionally prepended by a negative sign (U+002D). The resulting character sequence may include leading or trailing white spaces.<br><span class="code">
<tt>0<br>
123<br>
-98</tt></span><br>
<br><b>Loose:</b> All white spaces are removed from the character sequence first. Then, the remaining character sequence (<em>abcde</em>) is interpreted according to the <em>Strict</em> model. If this fails to create a valid number, the last character is dropped from the sequence (<em>abcd</em>) and then, the sequence is tested again. This continues until a valid number is produced or until no character remains, after which the character sequence is determined to be an invalid number.<br><span class="code">

<br>
<b>Strict:</b> Permitted is any sequence of at least one decimal digit in the range from 0 to 9 (U+0030 - U+0039), optionally interleaved by exactly one decimal separator in form of the period (U+002E), optionally prepended by a negative sign (U+002D). The resulting character sequence may include leading or trailing white spaces.<br><span class="code">
<tt>123<br>

123.0<br>
123.456<br>
0.456<br>

-123.456</tt></span><br>
<br><b>Loose:</b> All white spaces are removed from the character sequence first. Then, the remaining character sequence (<em>abcde</em>) is interpreted according to the <em>Strict</em> model. If this fails to create a valid number, the last character is dropped from the sequence (<em>abcd</em>) and then, the sequence is tested again. This continues until a valid number is produced or until no character remains, after which the character sequence is determined to be an invalid number.<br><span class="code">
<tt>-123 . 456<br>
987,333</tt></span><br>
<span class="code">
<tt>-123.456<br>
987</tt></span><br>
<br><a name="times"></a>
<br><br>
<font size="+1" color="#0080FF">■ 4. Times</font><hr>
<br>
<b>Legacy:</b> Permitted is any of the following sequences:<br><span class="code">
<tt><em>hhh</em><b>.</b><em>mmss</em><br>
<em>hhh</em><b>.</b><em>mms</em><br>
<em>hhh</em><b>.</b><em>mm</em><br>
<em>hhh</em><b>.</b><em>m</em><br>
<em>hhh</em></tt></span><br>
In these sequences, <em>hhh</em> denotes any sequence of at least one decimal digit to indicate the hour, <em>mm</em> denotes the two-digit minute part, <em>m</em> denotes a one-digit minute part, <em>ss</em> denotes a two-digit second part, <em>s</em> denotes a one-digit second part, and the character to separate the hours from the minutes is the period (U+002E). All digits need to be characters from 0 to 9 (U+0030 - U+0039). Leading or trailing white spaces are ignored. The total time is determined via the following formula, resulting in seconds since midnight:<br><table>
<tr>
<td width="16" valign="top"></td><td>
<font size="-1"><em>Seconds since midnight for a given time:</em></font>
</td></tr><tr>
<td width="16" valign="top">ƒ</td><td bgcolor="#FFD8C0" style="border:1px dotted;">
<tt>3600*<em>hhh</em> + 60*<em>mm</em> + <em>ss</em></tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
If minutes or seconds are not indicated, they are assumed to be zero. You can use any non-negative hour, including values greater than or equal to 24. If, for example, a station arrival time is 23:59:00 (day 1), and the arrival time of the following station is 00:02:15 (day 2), then use the following sequences to represent these times in order to ensure a chronological order:<br><span class="code">
<tt>23.5900<br>
24.0215</tt></span><br>
<br><a name="colors"></a>

<font size="+1" color="#0080FF">■ 5. Color values</font><hr>
<br>
<b>Hexcolor:</b> A six-digit hexadecimal number is preceded by a number sign character (U+0023). An individual hexadecimal digit can be comprised of the decimal digits from 0 to 9 (U+0030 - U+0039), the lowercase letters from a to f (U+0061 - U+0066) and the uppercase letters from A to F (U+0041 - U+0046). The hexcolor has the following form:<br><span class="code">
<tt>#<em>RRGGBB</em></tt></span><br>
In this sequence, <em>RR</em> represents the red component, <em>GG</em> the green component and <em>BB</em> the blue component. Each component ranges from 00 to FF (0 - 255), where 00 represents no contribution for that channel and FF full contribution.<br><br>Commonly used colors (to indicate transparency) include:<br><span class="code">
<tt><font color="black">#000000 (black)</font><br>
<font color="red">#FF0000 (red)</font><br>
<font color="green">#00FF00 (green)</font><br>
<font color="blue">#0000FF (blue)</font><br>
<font color="#00C0C0">#00FFFF (cyan)</font><br>
<font color="fuchsia">#FF00FF (magenta)</font><br>
<font color="yellow">#FFFF00 (yellow)</font><br>
<font color="white">#FFFFFF (white)</font></tt></span><br>
